# \[Ma\]nual \[G\]raphics \[E\]ngine
A lightweight, homemade 3D graphics engine that uses OpenGL Core 3.3 to render
simple scenes.
This project will be a means by which I hope to demonstrate and practice good
project management, testing, and documentation while learning a bit about the 
OpenGL API along the way.
